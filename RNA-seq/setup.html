        <p>For everything we do with RNA-seq, all we'll be using is R. R is a well-known object-oriented language
          used in bioinformatics and many other applications. I recommend installing R <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">here</a>
          and installing RStudio <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a>. RStudio is an R IDE
          that makes working with R very easy.<br>
          As far as R packages that we'll be using, we'll list those at the top of each article as they're used and once they're
          installed locally, you just need to load them with the library() command to use them. A common package collection/bioinformatics
          software project that contains common bioinformatics pckages is Bioconductor. Bioconductor makes installing some packages
          more straightforward, so I recommend following the instructions <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/install/">here</a>.<br>
          If you're not already familiar with R or programming in general, we'll assume you have a working knowledge from this article
          moving forward. To learn and get practice with object-oriented languages and R specifically, there are plenty of online tutorials
          and interactive platforms out there. I personally recommend the <a href="https://swirlstats.com/">swirl</a> package which
          lets you learn R step-by-step right in your local interface with RStudio.</p>
